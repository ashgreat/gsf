Nonlinear error components ABSTRACT  
This paper considers a model that accommodates both output and input-specific inefficiency components (input 
slacks). We use a translog function to represent the underlying production technology in which the input slacks 
are generalized to have both deterministic (functions of exogenous variables) and stochastic components. 
Consequently, the composed error term becomes a nonlinear function of several error components, viz., a one- 
sided input slack vector (the dimension of which depends on the number of inputs), a one-sided output technical 
inefficiency and a two-sided random noise. Identification of two sets of one-sided errors is possible in a translog 
model because the vector of one-sided input slacks appears in additive form as well as interactively with the (log) 
inputs. Distributional assumptions on technical inefficiency and slacks also help in identification. Bayesian 
inference techniques are introduced, organized around Markov Chain Monte Carlo, especially the Gibbs sampler 
with data augmentation, to estimate these inefficiency components. For an empirical application we use a large 
unbalanced panel of the U.K. manufacturing firms. Slacks associated with labor and capital are found to be 
2.35% and 10.74%, on average. Output (revenue) loss from technical inefficiency is, on average, 2.43%, while 
revenue loss from input slacks is, on average, 9.2%.   
“… firms and economies do not operate on an outer-bound produc -
tion possibility surface consistent with their resources. Rather they 
actually work on a production surface that is well within that outer 
bound. ” (Leibenstein (1966) , p. 413). 
1.Introduction 
The importance of efficient use of resources has long been recognized 
in economics. The mainstream neoclassical paradigm assumes that 
producers always operate efficiently. However, in reality the producers 
are not always efficient. Two otherwise identical firms never produce 
the same output, and costs and profit are not the same. This difference in 
output, cost, and profit can be explained in terms of technical and 
allocative inefficiencies, and some unforeseen exogenous shocks. While 
explaining X-efficiency Leibenstein (1979) argued that “… There may be 
inefficiency in (1) labor utilization, (2) capital utilization ….” (1979, pp. 
13–14). Lack of full managerial effort is another source of inefficiency. Although Leibenstein did not provide a specific mathematical formula -
tion that can be directly taken to econometric estimation and testing, he 
provided many arguments and evidence to show that given the resources 
(inputs), produced output is never at its maximum. In general, X-effi -
ciency theory is concerned with the under-utilization of resources. If 
resources are underutilized cost (profit, revenue) is increased 
(decreased). Costs of these inefficiencies are also reflected in lower 
productivity of inputs. This might in turn lead to slowing down pro-
ductivity growth. 
Zvi Griliches (1994) in his American Economic Association presi-
dential address noted that: “Our theories tend to assume that we are, 
indeed, at the frontier and that we can only either move along it or try to 
shift it, the latter being a difficult and chancy business. In fact we may be 
far from our existing ‘frontiers ’.” Harvey Leibenstein (1966) ideas about 
X-efficiency, or more correctly X-inefficiency, did not get much of a 
sympathetic ear from us.” (Griliches 1994 , p. 16). According to Griliches 
the notion of X-inefficiency is indicative of unexploited profit

2opportunities and real economic growth will depend on ways of closing 
the gap between the observed state and the “frontier. ” 
This study follows Leibenstein (1966 , 1979) and considers a model 
which accommodates several aspects of inefficiency that Leibenstein 
alluded to. In particular the focus is on modeling both neutral (not 
associated with any particular input) as well as input-specific in-
efficiencies. The neutral part is often called managerial inefficiency 
while the input-specific components are viewed as slacks.1 For example, 
if a worker shirks (puts less than 100% of his/her effort) we can say that 
labor is not fully utilized and therefore, given everything else, labor use 
can be reduced without reducing output(s). To paraphrase Leibenstein 
(1966) , labor inefficiency (slack) can arise because labor contracts are 
never completely specified and workers cannot be forced to work with 
full effort (which is unobserved). Similarly, machines might not be used 
at their full capacity because workers handling the machines might not 
use them in the best possible way. In general, if an input is not used at its 
full capacity, it is said to have a slack. Finally, if managerial effort is 
lower because of, for example, non-competitive market conditions less 
output will be produced, ceteris paribus. In Leibenstein ’s terminology 
these are all X-inefficiency. 
To make the empirical model manageable from the statistical infer-
ence point of view, the study shows how to decompose X-inefficiency in 
to a neutral managerial inefficiency (output inefficiency) and non- 
neutral input-specific technical inefficiency (ISTI) components or 
input slacks.2 The distinguishing feature of the model is that output 
inefficiency and input slacks are separated. To be consistent with the 
terminology used in the stochastic frontier (SF) models, output in-
efficiency and technical inefficiency are interchangeably used. Simi-
larly, the non-neutral ISTI components and input slacks are 
synonymous. 
The standard SF models (Kumbhakar and Lovell (2000) , Kumbhakar 
et al. (2020) ) estimate inefficiency for each production unit. Often times, 
researchers examine factors that can influence these inefficiencies. 
However, these models fail to go in depths and examine how much of the 
inefficiency comes from what input (input-specific slacks). As a result of 
this the managers do not know how much of inefficiency comes from say 
labor. Knowing ISTI will help the managers to take steps in reducing 
slacks associated with the most inefficient input. If labor inefficiency is 
high, the manager of a production unit might consider supervising the 
workers more so that labor is used more efficiently. Thus ISTI provides 
more information about the sources of inefficiency which is useful for 
designing policies in reducing inefficiency. 
One can view output and input inefficiency from the directional 
distance function (DDF) angle in which both the magnitude and di-
rections are estimated using data. That is, contrary to the DDF in our 
model it is not necessary to assume directions to be exogenously given.3 
The unique feature of the paper is formulation of a generalized sto-
chastic frontier model which combines both output inefficiency and 
non-radial (input-specific) technical inefficiency and show how to esti-
mate them econometrically using a flexible production technology. The 
composed error term in such a model becomes a nonlinear function of 
several error components, viz., the one-sided input slack vector (the 
dimension of which depends on the number of inputs), a one-sided output technical inefficiency and two-sided random noise. Identifica -
tion of two sets of one-sided errors is possible in a translog model 
because the vector of one-sided input slacks appears in additive form as 
well as interactively with the (log) inputs. In addition, this study ac-
counts for endogeneity of inputs and provides Bayesian diagnostics for 
“weak instruments ” in this context. Moreover, it is shown that all the 
existing efficiency models can be derived as special cases of the gener -
alized model. The study proposes using Bayesian inference techniques 
organized around Markov Chain Monte Carlo, especially the Gibbs 
sampler with data augmentation, to estimate these inefficiency com-
ponents. For an empirical application a translog production function is 
estimated using a large unbalanced panel of the U.K. manufacturing 
firms. 
The outline of the rest of the paper is as follows. Section 2 contains a 
discussion of some ISTI models that are used in the existing literature 
and shows the generality of the new model. The formal model with input 
slacks and technical inefficiency is introduced in Section 3 using the 
translog production function. The econometric model and inference 
techniques are presented in Section 4. Section 5, addresses the issue of 
endogenous regressors. Results from estimating a translog production 
function with and without endogeneity corrections using an unbalanced 
panel of 582 British manufacturing firms, previously analyzed by Nickell 
(1996) and Nickell et al. (1997) , is discussed in Section 5. Section 6 
summarizes the main results. 
2.Early literature and rudiments of a formal output and input 
inefficiency model 
The concept of ISTI goes back to Kopp (1981) who discussed it 
graphically but never estimated it econometrically. Kumbhakar (1988) 
proposed an estimable econometric model along this route and but his 
analysis was confined within the Cobb-Douglas production function 
framework. Furthermore, neither Kopp nor Kumbhakar did separate 
technical inefficiency from input slacks in their models. Our idea of 
separating the ISTI from technical inefficiency helps us to get the 
off-the-shelf measure of technical inefficiency as a special case (when 
slacks are zero), and the ISTI of Kopp and Kumbhakar (when technical 
inefficiency is zero). 
The notion of ISTI is also closely related to the idea of ‘effective 
input ’ proposed in Koop et al. (2000 , hereafter KOS) which is defined as 
the product of actual input and the ‘efficiency factor ’.4 The efficiency 
factors in KOS are input-specific and are deterministic functions of 
input-specific vectors of exogenous variables (say z). That is, the z var-
iables are input-specific in KOS. In our terminology (as explained in the 
next section) ‘effective input ’ is slack adjusted input and the ‘efficiency 
factor ’ is related to ISTI. Furthermore, it has both deterministic and 
stochastic components. The deterministic components are functions of 
the same exogenous variables. That is, unlike KOS this study does not 
require the z variables to be input-specific in our ISTI model, and in the 
extreme case (without any exogenous variables) our ISTI is simply a 
vector of one-sided random variables. The Cobb-Douglas production 
function used in KOS cannot identify the efficiency factors unless these 
are functions of input-specific exogenous variables. The ISTI model can 
identify the input-specific efficiency factors because a flexible functional 
form is used. Since a stochastic component is allowed in ISTI, the 
(composed) error term in the translog ISTI model becomes a nonlinear 
function of several error components, viz., the one-sided input slack 
vector (the dimension of which depends on the number of inputs), a 1 The word ‘slack ’ is used in Data Envelopment Analysis (which is based on 
programming technique), which is an alternative to stochastic frontier analysis. 
For details see Ray (2004) and references cited in there.  
2 The stochastic frontier literature, as it stands now, does consider either only 
output technical inefficiency or input technical inefficiency (radial) which as-
sumes proportional reduction in all inputs. There are currently no models with 
input slacks with or without output technical inefficiency in the SF literature.  
3 Although there are many applications in which the directions are assumed 
to be exogenous, there are approaches in which directions are assumed (Fare 
et al. (2013) , Hampf and Krüger (2015) , Atkinson and Tsionas (2016) , among 
others. 4 This idea in a slightly different form can be found in Sato and Beckmann 
(1968) , Burmeister and Dobell (1969) , Beckmann and Sato (1969) . They call it 
a factor augmenting model of technical change in which input efficiency factors 
are augmented by exponential functions of time and are deterministic as in 
KOS. This is also the framework used in Gollop and Roberts (1981) . However, 
none of these models allow observation-specific input efficiency. S.C. Kumbhakar and M.G. Tsionas

3one-sided technical inefficiency and a two-sided random noise. Identi -
fication of two sets of one-sided errors is possible in a translog model 
because the vector of one-sided input slacks appears in additive form as 
well as interactively with the (log) inputs. On the other hand, the 
one-sided technical inefficiency terms appear only additively. Distribu -
tional assumptions on technical inefficiency and slacks also help in 
identification. These issues will be clear after the formal model is pre-
sented in Section 3. Since input slacks in the models are new it is possible 
to test formally the validity of the new specification against only neutral 
component, and the presence of ISTI in only one input using marginal 
likelihoods. Furthermore, endogeneity of inputs is addressed following 
Tran and Tsionas (2013) . The study finds significant and economically 
important differences in the estimated inefficiency after correcting for 
endogeneity. 
Bernstein et al. (2004) specified a production technology in terms of 
inputs that are scaled by input-specific parameters purporting to mea-
sure input-specific technical inefficiency. The product of these param -
eters and actual inputs generate efficiency adjusted input levels. They 
assert that these parameters capture net efficiencies from changes in 
input usage and adjustment costs. Their measures are input-specific but 
not firm-specific. Gollop and Roberts (1981) proposed a similar measure 
within the context of a cost function by introducing input price-specific 
functions that scale individual input prices and hence presumably 
measure input-specific technical inefficiency. These are allowed to vary 
over time in a deterministic fashion and are firm-invariant. 
Chambers, Chung, and Fare (1998) introduced the DDF to model the 
direction towards the frontier from an inefficient production plan by 
expanding the outputs and contracting the inputs. DDF is specified as 
δXCY†gXCgYCΨsup⊔δ†X δgXCYδgY∃Ψ⊓, which, projects the 
output and input vectors XCY∃<JM onto the technology frontier in a 
direction determined by a vector d gXCgY, where gXCgY∃<JM

and Ψ is the feasible production set. The DDF δXCY†gXCgYCΨshows that 
given the direction vector  gXCgY, inputs X can be reduced by δBgX and 
simultaneously outputs can be increased by δBgY. Generality of the DDF 
lies in the fact that it allows outputs are to be expanded and inputs to be 
contracted simultaneously. Thus, the traditional output and input- 
oriented measures become special cases of DDF. Although the superi -
ority of DDF is advocated in terms of its flexibility in choosing the di-
rection, in their empirical model the direction vector ( gXCgY) is chosen 
exogenously. Since δ is a scalar, this means that in the end all the outputs 
are increased by an equal amount (δ) and all the inputs are decreased by 
the same amount (δ). Thus, the DDF loses much of its steam when it 
comes to empirical application. Furthermore, as noted by Hudgins and 
Primont (2007) only two parametric functions, namely, the 
logarithmic-transcendental and the quadratic (without an intercept 
term) forms satisfy the requirements of the DDF. None of these functions 
are popular empirically. 
Table 1 summarizes the contribution of some papers that focus on 
either ISTI and/or decomposition of productivity into input-specific 
components. 
The preset study considers a specification that looks similar to DDF 
but it does not restrict it in choosing the direction a priori , and the di-
rections are not same for all pairs of inputs and outputs. Instead of 
focusing on directions, the focus is on proportional reduction in inputs 
and increase in outputs which are input and output-specific. Note that 
directions are important to determine reduction in inputs and increase in 
outputs. If these proportions are determined, the direction can be 
automatically determined. Thus, in the present formulation the focus is 
not on direction but proportional reduction in inputs and increase in 
outputs. Since we deal with proportions, our measures are not affected 
by units of measurement and one can use the popular functional forms 
such the translog. 
The production technology is specified in terms of a transformation 
function which is augmented to include inefficiency in Y and X, i.e., 
FΛ©YCΘ©XA, where Λm≽1 indicates inefficiency in output Ym and Θj≼1 indicates inefficiency in the use of input j. Note that here Λ 
and Θ are output- and input-specific, and ©represents the Hadamard 
product. We call it generalized stochastic frontier (GSF) model, where 
the stochastic part of it comes from A specified as AA0ev. Here v is a 
random noise term with zero mean. 
The idea of input and output inefficiency is illustrated in Fig. 1 with 
one input and one output. Point A shows the observed input output 
combination which is below the production frontier YfX. If the 
optimal input output combination (determined from, say, profit maxi-
mization behavior) is given by the point B, the presence of input in-
efficiency is indicated from the fact that XoDXa and inefficiency in the 
production of output is indicated by YoFYa. That is, by fully elimi -
nating input inefficiency input use can be reduced by (Xa Xo) and 
production of output can be increased byYo Ya. Alternatively, an 
inefficient firm could simultaneously increase its output by Λ 1×100 
percent and decrease its input use X by 1 Θ×100 percent. Note that 
in terms of the figure ΛYoEYa≽1 and ΘXoEXa≼1B
Input and output inefficiency in Fig. 1 can be easily related to 
reduction in input use and increase in output in the DDF formulation, 
presented in Fig. 2. Note that X gXδ in Fig. 2 is the optimal amount of 
X, which in our framework of Fig. 1 is indicated by XΘ. That is, X gXδ
ΘX⇒X1 Θgxδ⊇ΔX, which implies ΔXEX1 Θ. Therefore, if 
X gXδ is known, so is Θ. Similarly, we can write Y gYδΛY which 
gives Λ 1gYδEY. Thus, from Λ one can recover gYδ and vice-versa. 
From this, it is clear that the two representations are quite similar. 
The main difference is that the DDF is expressed in levels of inputs and 
outputs, while the GSF model is expressed in logarithms of inputs and 
outputs. Note that optimal point (direction) in both figures is deter -
mined by profit maximization behavior. 
Similar to the DDF, the SF models used in the literature can be shown 
as special cases of GSF. For example, if Θj1⊥j and ΛmΛ⊥m the GSF 
model reduces to the output-oriented technical inefficiency model. 
Similarly, if Λm1⊥m and ΘjΘ⊥j the GSF model reduces to the 
input-oriented technical inefficiency model. Finally, if ΛmΛ⊥m, Θj
Θ⊥j and Λ×Θ1, the GSF model reduces to the hyperbolic in-
efficiency model. Another special case (in a single output model) is when 
Λ1. This would be a model to estimate input slacks, given output. The 
model is used in a cost function set-up by Kumbhakar and Tsionas 
(2012). However, they did not estimate input efficiency. In the Data 
Envelopment Analysis literature input-specific inefficiency is estimated 
in Mahlberg and Sahoo (2011) , Kapelko et al. (2015) , Oude Lansink 
et al. (2002) , and Skevas and Oude Lansink (2014) . 
In summary, the present study uses a translog production function to 
estimate a generalized efficiency model with input slacks and technical

4inefficiency. The inputs slacks have both deterministic (functions of 
exogenous variables) and stochastic components. Furthermore, these 
are observation-specific. Separating input slacks from technical in-
efficiency necessitates the use of a flexible functional form such as the 
translog in the generalized model. This enables an examination of the 
role of the exogenous factors on effectiveness (X-efficiency/productiv -
ity) of inputs and test whether technical inefficiency is neutral (the way 
it is modeled in the standard stochastic frontier literature following 
Aigner et al. (1977) and Meeusen and van den Broeck (1977) ). Thus, the 
generalized model provides an extension of the Kumbhakar (1988) and 
the KOS models. It also provides both economic and econometric gen-
eralizations to Caselli and Coleman (2006) (in which restrictive func-
tional forms and assumptions are used). To estimate the model, 
proposed are Bayesian inference techniques organized around Markov 
Chain Monte Carlo, especially the Gibbs sampler with data augmenta -
tion, to estimate the inefficiency components. The model is of special 
interest to managers and managerial economists as it provides more 
information on efficiency. Most stochastic frontier models provide an 
overall efficiency measure which is hard to interpret as it does not say 
how it relates to individual inputs. The present model deviates from 
standard practice and focuses explicitly on input-specific efficiency so 
that management knows the sources of inefficiency in production. In 
fact, the model clearly shows the channels through which inefficiency 
affects output. 
3.Formalizing the GSF model 
3.1. Production function with input and output inefficiency 
Given the concepts discussed in Fig. 1, a mathematical formulation of 
the production function is written as follows: 
ΛiYiAifX1iΘ1iCBBBCXJiΘJi⇒~YiAif[
~X1iCBBBC~XJi]
Ci1CBBBCnC (1)  
where Y is a single output, X is a vector of J inputs and f(.) is the pro-
duction technology. The subscript i indexes firm and j indexes inputs. 
The term Ai is the shift parameter and is also captures stochastic nature 
of production, Λi≽1 captures firm-specific output efficiency. The input- 
and firm-specific efficiency factors are captured by Θji0≼Θji≼1⊥jCi. Thus, ~XjiXjiΘji is input j in efficiency (slack adjusted) units. Similarly, 
~YiYiΛiis output in efficiency unit. Alternatively,1 Θji≽0 is the 
percentage (when multiplied by 100) by which the input j is over used 
by firm i, and Λi 1≽0 is the percent by which output could be 
increased. The existence of input slacks can explain differences in input 
productivity (effectiveness) among firms. Thus, this formulation of the 
production function captures both (output) technical efficiency and 
input slacks (existence of which can explain differences in effectiveness 
of inputs). If there are no slacks in any of the inputs Θji1⊥jCiCone 
gets back to the standard output-oriented stochastic frontier model in 
which lnΛ≽0 captures output inefficiency. Note that it is not required 
to have panel data to estimate such a model. The question is whether one 
can separate these two types of inefficiencies, given that this formulation 
is neither discussed in Kopp (1981) , Kumbhakar (1988) nor in KOS. This 
is addressed in the context of a flexible (translog) production function in 
the next section. 
Although the model in (1) looks similar to the KOS model, there are 
some important differences between these two models. The KOS model 
does not include output technical inefficiency. However, the concept of 
‘effective input ’ in KOS is same as our ‘slack adjusted input ’. The dif-
ferences are in the specification of the Θji functions, which are more 
flexible in our model. These are discussed in the next section. The new 
model has some features that are similar to Gollop and Roberts (1981) 
and Bernstein et al. (2004) , although none of these models introduced 
observation-specific (i.e., firm-specific in a cross-section and both 
firm-specific and time-varying in a panel) input slack (effectiveness) 
measures. The slack measures in the present study, contain both deter -
ministic and stochastic components which are not introduced in any of 
the previous papers. Consequently, the new model generalizes all the 
previous models – both frontier and non-frontier specifications.

constitutes the translog GSF model. The zi variables are introduced as 
neutral technology shifters via lnAi and determinants of input in-
efficiency (lnΘi) via (3b). The negative values of θji≪1 AjiC
multiplied by 100, can be interpreted as the percentage over-use of input 
j for firm i. Output technical inefficiency is captured by the u0i term. The 
usual stochastic noise component (ε0i) captures exogenous shocks in the 
production technology. In the absence of the slacks, the generalized 
inefficiency model reduces to the standard stochastic frontier model of 
Aigner et al. (1977) and Meeusen and van den Broeck (1977) . The

5presence of the slacks can be econometrically tested. One can also test 
whether inefficiency is only in the output (only technical inefficiency) or 
in the slacks (no technical inefficiency).5 
One can justify the claim that the model specified in (2) and (3) is 
much more general by arguing that it clearly shows the channels 
through which inefficiency affects output. If one believes that there is 
inefficiency and part of it can be explained by some exogenous variables 
(z) variables, then it is natural to think of the channels through which 
inefficiency affects output. A direct channel through which the z vari-
ables affect output in a neutral fashion (neutral to the regular input 
variables (x)) and enter into the production function through the shift 
parameter (namely the δ∕zi part in lnAiin considered in (3a)). The effect 
of unobserved variables affecting output through this channel is 
captured by the one-sided random term u0iin (3a).6 In addition, these z 
variables can also affect output indirectly by affecting input productivity 
which is captured by the slacks in (3b). This indirect channel is ‘new ’ 
and has not been used in the traditional SF models (with or without the z 
variables) which are special cases of our general model. 
Several comments on the GSF model in (2) and (3) are in order, 
particularly in relation to the KOS model. First, equation (2) is a translog 
whereas it is a Cobb-Douglas in KOS. Second, in the new model the same 
z variables can affect ‘effectiveness ’ of all inputs whereas in KOS the z 
variables are input-specific (i.e., effectiveness of each input is explained 
by a separate set of z variables). Third, in the new model the input 
effectiveness parameters contain both deterministic and stochastic 
components whereas these are completely deterministic in KOS. Thus, 
even if there are no z variables, the new model can provide estimates of 
ISTI in a translog model. This, however, is not the case in the KOS model. 
It is possible to rewrite (2) after substituting (3) as

where qiαBxi is the output elasticity vector (∂yiE∂xi). In this form, 
the model consists of the usual translog production frontier (with a 
neutral shift via the z variables) and a composed error term that is a 
nonlinear function of several error components, viz.,

The composed error term vi in (5) consists of (i) a quadratic function 
of the non-positive input slack vector θi (the dimension of which de-
pends on the number of inputs), (ii) non-positive technical inefficiency 
component u0i, and (iii) the random noise component ε0i. That is, the 
composed error term vi is a function of two sets of one-sided error 
components θi and u0i) and a two-sided error term ε0i. Furthermore, it is 
nonlinear in θi and depends on the input quantities as well. The question 
is, whether one can identify all these components, especially, the non- 
positive slack vector θi from the non-positive technical inefficiency 
component u0i. The answer is in the affirmative because the θi vector 
appears in both linear θ∕
iα and quadratic forms (1
2θ∕
iBθi). It also appears 
interactively with the xi vector θ∕
iBxi. On the other hand, the technical 
inefficiency component u0i appear only linearly. Furthermore, distri -
butional assumptions on θiCu0iand ε0i will help in identification. 
Some special cases of the model might be of interest. If the per-centage over-use of all the inputs are exactly the same (i.e.θjiθiCj1C
BBBCJ) and u0i 0, then one obtains a stochastic translog production 
frontier model with input-oriented technical inefficiency (Kumbhakar 
and Tsionas (2006) ), in which the composed error term is [

frontier function with output-oriented technical inefficiency in which 
the composed error term is the sum of u0i and ε0i. Note that the condi -

so that it is data-dependent. Moreover, it depends on the parameters in Δ 
and Ω. The importance of these issues will become clear in the course of 
the discussion. 
The pdf of θi is: 5 Since the concept is new, we used the profit maximization argument to 
explain the concept of non-radial inefficiency associated with input use and 
production of output. So, the graph we used is for illustration of the concept. 
However, we did not setup a model that include the first-order conditions of 
profit maximization which require information on output and input prices. This 
will involve a system approach and a different estimation approach. Also, we 
don’t have price information in the data.  
6 It is possible to extend the model further and let the zi variables affect 
output via the output efficiency terms Λi. 7 By vec() we denote the usual vectorization operator. The operator vech() 
stacks the different elements of row vectors of a certain matrix. S.C. Kumbhakar and M.G. Tsionas

Analytical integration of (8) with respect to θi is not possible, 
although the univariate integral with respect to u0i can be computed 
analytically (Kumbhakar and Lovell, 2000 , p. 96). Unfortunately, this 
leads to further nonlinearities involving the standard normal distribu -
tion function, and it is not advisable to proceed along this path. The 
MCMC procedure is described in Part 1 of the Technical Appendix. 
Part 2 of Appendix provides a discussion of computing elasticities in 
the context of the new model. 
4.Endogenous regressors 
So far, it has been assumed that the inputs are exogenous. To address 
possible endogeneity of the input variables (inputs being correlated with 
the composed error term in (4)), one can keep the basic structure of the 
model the same (equation (4)) but assume availability of panel data. In 
turn, one can express the input vector xit as: 
Assumption 5.

which is a panel vector auto-regression (VAR) for xit including the 
variables in ~zit which are assumed strictly exogenous in the sense that 
their expectations conditional on all error terms are zero. The endoge -
neity is captured by allowing for correlation between ξit and ε0it as in

is a standard stochastic frontier model. This equation has to be 
embedded in the context of the panel VAR in (12) from which identifi -
cation of Γ and Ωξ is possible. Compared to the methods developed in 
the previous section, (14) is a minor extension in which updates of the 
elements of Γ are made from the joint conditional posterior distribution 
defined by (14) and (12) .8 Draws from the conditional posterior dis-
tribution of η are straightforward and draws from the conditional pos-
terior distribution of ρ are implicit in this construction. 
Additional details are provided in Part 3 of Appendix. 
5.Empirical results 
The new model proposed in the paper is estimated using an unbal -
anced panel of 582 British manufacturing firms previously analyzed by 
Nickell (1996) and Nickell and Nicolitsas (1999) . Details on the con-
struction of the variables used here can be found in these two papers. 
The total number of observations in the data set is 5273 and the number 
of yearly observations for each firm ranges from 5 to 13. For estimation 
purposes, the following translog production function is used: 
logYitflogLitClogKitvit  
where Yit represents firm sales9 (deflated by producer price index of the 
three-digit industry in which the firm belongs), Lit is labor (number of 
employees), and Kit is capital. The function f (.) is assumed to be 
translog. Although this data set does not have information on other in-
puts like materials, use of it is made because this data has some inter-
esting z variables. In this sense the application might be viewed as an 
illustration of the new technique. Moreover, Nickell (1996) and Nickell 
and Nicolitsas (1999) are well known for addressing the relationship 
between competition and financial pressure on firm performance. 
Because of this particular data set is quite useful as a benchmark to apply 
the new techniques. This study follow the spirit of the analysis in Nickell 
(1996) and Nickell and Nicolitsas (1999) , and uses the following vari-
ables as the determinants of input slacks: concentration ratio (CR), the 
market share (MS), import penetration (IMP), trend (TREND) and 
financial pressure (FP). Market share is defined as the ratio of firm sales pyiCu0iCθi†xiCzi 

Given Γ all the parameters in (12), in turn, can be drawn from a multivariate

9 Ideally one should use materials in estimating the production function when 
the dependent variable is sales. Unfortunately, materials is not available in the 
data set and this has not been included in Nickell (1996) , Nickell and Nicolitsas 
(1999) and some other studies that used this data. Omission of materials is 
likely to affect results and thus our results should be viewed as illustrative. S.C. Kumbhakar and M.G. Tsionas

7over industry total sales. Financial pressure is defined as the ratio of 
interest payments over the sum of profits before tax, depreciation and 
interest payments. Concentration ratio is five-firm concentration ratio in 
terms of sales. Import penetration is the ratio of imports over home 
demand (sales imports – exports). All these z variables are used in 
explaining capital- and labor-specific slacks (i.e., θKCθL). Using only a 
time trend would make the analysis somewhat close (ex post) to the 
deterministic analysis in Caselli and Coleman (2006) . 
Regression parameters (δ and Δ0vecΔ) are a priori (or margin -
ally) independent N0C103Ivariables with the respective dimensions. 
For the scale parameters (σ2 and σ2
u) we use proper priors with qqu
0B001 and nnu1. The same priors were selected for σ2
λ and σ2
τ. For 
Ω, our Wishart prior has nΩ1, and Σ0B001⋅I. 
For implementing the Gibbs sampler see the discussion in 
Appendix A regarding the various tuning parameters and the number of 
iterations M1CM2, and M. Overall, the present study used ten million 
passes (after using Geweke ’s diagnostic, (Geweke, 1999 )). The compu -
tation of marginal likelihood for these models involves a total of 
nintegrals of dimension J1. Presented are two sets of results, viz., with 
and without endogeneity corrections. In Table 2, presented are summary 
statistics of the inefficiency and slack measures together with input 
elasticities. The model with endogeneity correction refers to the system 
based on (12) and (14) and results therefrom are referred to as system in 
various tables/figures. 
Mean output technical inefficiency u0 based on the endogeneity 
corrected model is found to be 2.43% with a standard deviation 1.8%. 
This means, on average, sales revenue is 2.43% lower due to technical 
inefficiency. The interesting finding is the presence of slacks in both 
labor and capital, which led to their over-use. Mean over-use of labor 
and capital (negative values of θ) are 2.35% and 10.74% (with standard 
deviations 3.79% and 2.91%). Thus, relative to labor, capital is over- 
used by nearly a factor of four. These results are reported in Table 2 
(in summary form) and the details are in Fig. 2c which plots these in-
efficiencies for all observations. It can be seen that slacks in capital are 
distributed symmetrically but have wide variation. On the other hand, 
the slack in labor has a long right tail but there are fewer firms for which 
slacks in labor are as high as slacks in capital. 
Results from the model that ignores endogeneity of the inputs are 
quite different. Mean output technical inefficiency u0 is found to be 
3.73% with a standard deviation 2.48%. This means, on average, sales 
revenue is 3.73% lower due to technical inefficiency. Mean over-use of 
labor and capital are 10.23% and 19.23% (with standard deviations 
8.4% and 9.5%). Thus, capital is over-used nearly double of labor. 
Fig. 2a plots these inefficiencies for all observations. It can be seen that 
slacks in capital have wide variation. On the other hand, the slack in 
labor has long right tail but there are fewer firms for which slacks in 
labor are as high as slacks in capital. 
Existence of input slacks indicates that inputs are not used with 
100% effectiveness. As a result of this produced output will be less than 
maximum possible. This potential reduction in output for our translog 
model is given by the expression θ∕
iqi1
2θ∕
iBθi in (4). The resulting dis-
tribution of output loss is given in Fig. 2b in which we also include 
technical inefficiency since it is interpreted as output loss due to 
managerial inefficiency. Thus, both the components in Fig. 2b measure 
output loss and can be compared. Output loss due to input slacks is, on 
average, 15.10% with a standard deviation of 7.2%. This, when added to 
technical inefficiency, gives a total output loss of 18.83%, on average, 
due to both types of inefficiency. The distribution of output loss for Table 1

8system approach with endogeneity correction is reported in Fig. 2d. 
Output loss due to input slacks is, on average, 9.2% with a standard 
deviation of 4.3%. This, when added to technical inefficiency, gives a 
total output loss of 11.63%, on average, due to both types of inefficiency. 
Since these estimates are available for each observation, it might be 
interesting to examine them for each firm. To conserve space, these 
measures are reported for the 5 worst and the 5 best firms in Fig. 3. It can 
be seen that these measures vary substantially across the best and worst 
firms. Fig. 3a and b plot the posterior distributions of output technical 
inefficiency for the 5 worst and best firms. These figures show that the 
distributions of the worst firms vary substantially. On the contrary, the 
posterior distributions of inefficiency for the best 5 firms are very 
similar. The same conclusion holds for the posterior distributions of 
slacks in capital (Fig. 3c and d) and slacks in labor (Fig. 3e and f). The 
posterior distributions of output losses from slacks in capital and labor 
for the 5 worst and 5 best firms are shown in Fig. 3g and h. In this case, 
the distributions for the worst as well as the best 5 firms are quite 
different. 
The average input elasticities from Elas i∂Eyi†ziCxi
∂xiαBxiθi
are 0.519 for labor and 0.414 for capital (with standard deviations 0.021 
and 0.042 respectively). These input elasticities are often interpreted as 
share of input costs to total value of output (revenue). Thus, on average, 
labor cost share is more than that of capital. The input elasticities are 
uniquely related to returns to scale (RTS), viz., RTS is the sum of these 
input elasticities. The RTS average is around 0.933 (with standard de-
viation 0.131) (see Table 1). In Nickell (1996) the labor elasticities were 
0.73 (t-statistic 8.3) and 0.17 respectively but the t-statistic is not 
reported. 
The distributions of input elasticities and RTS are reported in Fig. 4a 
and b for the models without and with endogeneity correction. These 
distributions are symmetric with positive values (within the [0,1] in-
terval), as expected from theory. It can be seen from Fig. 4a and b that 
most of the firms are operating below unitary RTS (efficient scale size). 
There are more firms with decreasing RTS than increasing RTS, which 
means that there are potential for some firms to expand since they are 
operating below their efficient scale size. Also note that although capital 
and labor elasticities from the models with and without endogeneity 
correction are quite different, the estimated RTS (sum of these two 
elasticities) are quite similar. 
Estimates of the coefficients associated with the z variables in the 
input slack functions θKand θLin (3b) are reported in Table 3. Since 
lnXj ln~Xj θj≽0 the Δcoefficients (when multiplied by  1) are 
marginal effects of the z variables on input slacks (input over-use). Thus, 
an increase in concentration ratio, CR (less competition) increases slacks 
in both labor and capital. That is, if the market is less competitive inputs will be over-used. This result can be used to support the quiet life hy-
pothesis of a monopolist – lower work effort is associated with less 
competition. All other z variables reduce slacks in both labor and capital 
(except for market share in capital). The negative coefficients on the 
TREND variable show that input over-use have decreased over time. 
To focus more on the importance of the z variables on input-specific 
slacks, one can first compute the posterior means and posterior s.d. of 
the θ parameters from their MCMC draws of the Bayesian posterior 
distribution for the model in (4) with endogeneity correction (equation 
(14)). Then, one can calculate the marginal effects of each of the z 
variable on the means of posterior of θ. These derivatives are calculated 
numerically after obtaining Eθ†yCXCZfrom the formulae in Tallis 
(1961) . The results are reported in Table 4. 
Since Nickell (1996) incorporated the z variables into the production 
function, a direct comparison with our results is not straightforward. His 
findings are as follows. The coefficient of market share at the period t-2 
was  1.30 (t 2.5), the coefficient of concentration ratio was  0.061 (t 
2.00), for import penetration it was  0.023 (t 0.80), for size it was 
0.39 (t 2.50) and for rents it was 0.39 (t 2.50), see Table 2 in Nickell 
(1996 , p. 638). These results are marginally significant judging from 
their t-statistics. In our framework, the effect of these variables are input 
as well as firm-specific unlike Nickell (1996) formulation. Despite this 
fact from the last column of our Table 4 it turns our that marginal effects 
are material and are tightly estimated as posterior standard deviations 
are much lower than posterior means. Moreover, signs for concentration 
ratio and market share differ from those reported by Nickell (1996) . 
It can be seen from Table 4 that, on average, higher concentration 
ratio, market shares, and financial pressure decrease input-slacks and 
therefore increases productivity of both inputs. When CR increases 
(competition decreases), we expect less pressure to reduce slacks for 
both labor and capital. Similarly, when the market share of a particular 
firm increases and the firm is in a monopolistic situation, firm managers Table 3

9might not be under pressure to increase work effort. This argument goes 
in line with ‘quiet life’ hypothesis of Hicks (1935) . Finally, if financial 
pressure increases it is likely to force the workers to work hard (thereby 
reducing slacks) and increase productivity. An increase in import 
penetration, on average, had a negligible increase in slack in labor. 
However, the increase in slack in capital is much higher. This might be 
due to the fact that firms that are heavily dependent on imports are 
likely to keep excess reserve of capital. Finally, change in slacks asso-
ciated with labor and capital over time are almost negligible. 
In the last column of Table 4, reported are the marginal effects of 
these z variables on E(lnY) computed from (11), holding inputs un-
changed. Since none of these z variables is in logarithmic terms, the 
marginal effects in (11) can be interpreted as semi-elasticities because y 
is in logs. Note that these z variables affect output directly (captured by 
δ0, the first term in (11)) and indirectly by affecting input productivity 
via slacks. These indirect effects are more complex and are captured by 
the last two terms in (11). More specifically, a z variable affects output 
indirectly by affecting the means and variances of slacks associated with 
both capital and labor. In Table 4 and Fig. 5, reported are the total 
(overall) effect for each of the z variables on ElnY. The concentration 
ratio has a positive overall effect on expected output ElnY. Market 
share has a negative overall effect on expected output. Financial pres-
sure and import penetration have a small positive overall effect on 
ElnY. Finally, productivity change (effect on mean output over time), 
on average is positive but quite small. Details on these marginal effects 
can be seen from Fig. 5 where the entire distributions in the sample are 
presented. 
The model proposed in the paper differs from the existing models in 
terms of the input slacks. In the absence of such slacks, the model will 
reduce to the standard translog stochastic frontier production model 
with output inefficiency. Thus, it is desirable to test the appropriateness 
of the new model. Bayes factors in favor of the hypothesis of no input 
slacks against three competing models are reported in Table 5. Since the 
dimensionality of the problem is small J2computing Bayes factors 
is not cumbersome. The results in Table 5 show that the null hypothesis 
(the traditional frontier model, SFM, which includes only radial tech-
nical inefficiency) is rejected (following Jeffrey ’s rule, i.e., Bayes factor 
in excess of 100:1 provides “decisive evidence ” in favor of the alterna -
tive hypothesis) against the ISTI, ISML and ISMK where ISTI allows 
slacks in both capital and labor; is the input-specific slack model, ISML 
and ISMK are the input-slack models allowing for slacks only in labor 
and capital, respectively. 
We also develop a test for weak instruments in the Bayesian frame -
work we used. Our focus is the panel vector autoregression in (12) where 
x∕
iCt 1Cz∕
iCt 1∕
⊇Git were assumed exogeneous. Although this cannot be 
disputed, at least on economic theory grounds, it can be debated 
whether these instruments are, in fact, “weak ”. Let us consider a stan-
dard regression model, say ytβxtζt where ζt is an error term that is 
not, necessarily, orthogonal to xt. Suppose there is a variable, ztthat is 
orthogonal to the error. It is not difficult to show that the so-called 
Instrumental Variables (IV) estimator bIV⋃n
t1ztyt⋃n
t1ztxtis always consistent 
under our assumptions. The problem, however, is that when the corre -
lation between xt and zt is low then the denominator in bIV is low and, as 
a result, the IV estimator will behave erratically. In the context of the 
panel vector autoregression in (12), we rely on the minimum R2 across 
all equations of (12) for each MCMC. If the values of R2 are “low” then 
we have weak instruments in the sense that xitand Gitare only weakly correlated. The marginal posterior density of minimum R2 across all 
MCMC draws is reported in Fig. 6 from which it is seen that xitand Gitare 
highly correlated. Since the R2 statistic may not be enough, we report 
three alternative F-tests for weak instruments, viz., Olea and Pflueger 
(2013) , Stock and Yogo (2005) and Kleibergen (2007) (see also Klei-
bergen, 2004 ; Stock et al., 2002 ). The rough guide is that if the F values 
exceed 10 (see Table 1 in Olea and Pflueger, 2013 ) the instruments are 
considered strong. The posterior (across MCMC draws) densities of the 
various F-tests well exceed this critical value so we are relatively 
confident that, for the data at hand, there is no weak instruments 
problem. 
6.Conclusion 
Although input slacks are an essential part of X-inefficiency, the ef-
ficiency literature has focused exclusively on the interpretation of X- 
inefficiency as output (managerial) inefficiency thereby ignoring the 
essential part of Leibenstein ’s argument that input slacks are important 
determinants of the X-inefficiency. In this paper a formal approach is 
proposed to jointly model input slacks and output technical inefficiency. 
The present study considers a model that accommodates both a neutral 
and input-specific inefficiency component. The neutral part is technical 
inefficiency while the input-specific components are labeled as slacks. 
The inputs slacks have both deterministic (functions of exogenous var-
iables) and stochastic components. More generally, it can be argued that 
if inefficiency exists then it is natural to think of the channels through 
which it affects output. In the proposed model some observed exogenous 
variables (z) and an unobserved one-sided random variable affect output 
neutrally. This is called the direct channel and it is what the traditional 
frontier models considers. The study goes beyond this and argues, in the 
spirit of Leibenstein, that these observed z variables along with some 
unobserved variables can also affect output indirectly by affecting input 
effectiveness (productivities) which are captured by the input slacks. 
This indirect channel is ‘new ’ and has not been used in the traditional 
stochastic frontier models. The new model also works if no z variables 
are available to explain input effectiveness. 
The present study used a flexible functional form (the translog) to 
represent the underlying production technology. The composed error 
term in such a model becomes a nonlinear function of several error 
components, viz., the one-sided input slack vector (the dimension of 
which depends on the number of inputs), one-sided neutral technical 
inefficiency and two-sided random noise. Identification of two sets of 
one-sided errors is possible in a translog model because the vector of 
one-sided input slacks appears in additive form as well as interactively 
with the (log) inputs. Distributional assumptions on technical in-
efficiency and slacks also help in identification. Bayesian inference 
techniques organized around Markov Chain Monte Carlo are used, 
especially the Gibbs sampler with data augmentation, to estimate these 
inefficiency components. Statistical inference in the new model is pro-
vided using MCMC techniques that are efficient and easy to work with. 
Since input slacks in the new models are new one can also test formally 
the validity of the new specification against only neutral component, 
and the presence of ISTI in only one input using marginal likelihoods. 
Furthermore, proper account is made for endogeneity of inputs and the 
study provided a test for weak instruments. 
The paper also provides an empirical application of the new meth -
odology to a large data on U.K. manufacturing. The study documents 
significant differences in the estimated inefficiency after correcting for 
endogeneity. Slacks associated with labor and capital are found to be S.C. Kumbhakar and M.G.

102.35% and 10.74%, on average. Mean output loss from neutral in-
efficiency is 2.43% (with a standard deviation of 1.83%), while output 
loss from input slacks is, on average, 9.2% with a standard deviation of 
4.3%. Since output is real sales, these findings suggest that sales reve-
nue, on average, is reduced by 11.63% due to both types of inefficiency. 
In terms of future research, it would be important to extend the model to the case of input-oriented or output-oriented (and perhaps other direc -
tional) distance functions. Although this extension is straightforward 
econometrically, it is, nevertheless, important for applied research. 
Another extension would be to incorporate firm effects and perhaps 
distinguish them from inefficiency.

SHORT DESCRIPTIONS OF SOME OF THE CONCEPTS USED 
Bayesian methods . Given a set of data, the parameters θ can be estimated using either sampling-theory methods like maximum likelihood, 
method of moments, etc., or Bayesian techniques. In Bayesian analysis, it is assumed that there is prior information about the parameters. It uses the 
Bayes ’ theorem which states that the posterior distribution of the parameter is proportional to the product of the prior and the likelihood. 
Data envelopment analysis . DEA is a linear programming analysis that can be used to provide efficiency scores for each decision-making units or 
firm given observations on their inputs and outputs. DEA is based on linear programming analysis, and it abstracts from the presence of noise in the 
data. Stochastic frontier models , on the other hand, take proper account of noise but use parametric assumptions about the functional form that 
relates inputs to outputs, unlike DEA which is based on piecewise linear approximation. 
Markov Chain Monte Carlo . MCMC is a set of techniques designed to produce a long sample of (not necessarily independent) draws from the 
posterior distribution of a parameter θ in a given model. MCMC techniques, in effect, provide access to complicated posterior distributions which often 
involve multivariate integrals that cannot be computed in closed form. One such MCMC technique is the Gibbs sampler. The Gibbs sampler produces a 
sequence of draws that converges to the posterior by providing random numbers from the full list of conditional distributions of the parameter vector 
θ.

i. See Tierney (1994) . Drawing from a multivariate normal distribution subject to 
inequality constraints has been considered before (Geweke, 1991 ).11 
To determine a “reasonable ” approximation θi, for each i1CBBBCn, we start by setting θi0, which corresponds to full input efficiency, and run the 
MCMC scheme for M1 iterations. At the end of the M1 iterations we set θi equal to the means of the θis. We rerun the MCMC for another M1 iterations 
and obtain the new means. The new means should be closer to a “reasonable ” approximation of θi. The Gibbs sampler is run again12 for M2 iterations 
but now we use as proposals distributions of the form NJ}θiChi}Vi, and adjust the his every 100 iterations to obtain acceptance rates close to 25–30%%. 
After completion, we take the proposals as given, and run a final MCMC scheme for M iterations to obtain final results (without any other tuning of the 
parameters). In practice we have used M1M2M(one million iterations). In our previous work (Kumbhakar and Tsionas, 2006 ) we have used a 
simplified procedure for a different but somewhat related model. In the context of the present model, we assumed θi0, and used the resulting 
J-variate normal as a proposal distribution. The procedure developed here is somewhat more complicated, but much more accurate.13 It remains to 
propose draws from the conditional posterior distributions of Ω, and Δ0vecΔ. The conditional posterior distribution of Ω, is the following:

i1CiΩCΔ 1, the conditional distribution would be 
Wishart with parameters nnΩ, and ΣΣ. 
Random number generation from Wishart distributions is straightforward. However, the term KΩCΔcomplicates things considerably, the dis-
tribution above is no longer a Wishart, and it is not a member of other known families. Random number generation is accommodated using a 
“Metropolis step”). Given a current draw, say Ω0, suppose Ωcis a candidate matrix draw from the Wishart distribution, with parameters nnΩ, and 
ΣΣ. Since KΩ0CΔhas already been computed,14 the candidate is accepted with probability min1CR, where RKΩcCΔ
KΩ0CΔ⋅ The only overhead is the 
computation of 1EKΩcCΔ̃n
i1CiΩcCΔ, and therefore the computation of the multivariate normal integrals CiΩcCΔ, for each i1CBBBCn.

terms containing the elements of the jth row of Ξ. Given our assumptions on Ξi, we have ξj⊃Nn0CΩ⊘In. This is the multivariate regression model 
analyzed by Tiao and Zellner (1964) . 
In the case of “non-informative priors ”, pΔjCΩ∝†Ω† J1E2, and the same set of regressors in each equation of the multivariate regression model,

when informative priors are placed on Δ0vecΔ, or equivalently the Δjs (j1CBBBCJ) as we do here. See also Zellner (1971 , pp. 240–242). 
The quantities }Δjand Vj, is computed by least squares regressions (on an equation by equation basis) conditional on Ω. In turn, it is straight -
forward to form a proposed vector Δc
